# LizzieLift

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of LizzieLift is to make the creation of lift curves with weighted data simple.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LizzieLift like so:

``` {r}
#for others:
#run devtools::install_github("easoneli176/LizzieLift") to install package

#on my personal machine
library(devtools)
library(LizzieLift)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(LizzieLift)

mock_data <- data.frame(preds=rep(1:4,10), target=rep(1:5,8), weights=rep(1:2,20))

wltable(mock_data,"preds","target","weights",3)
wlplot(mock_data,"preds","target","weights",3)
wlcredplot(mock_data,"preds","target","weights",3)

#when creating a package, use roxygen2::roxygenise() to create documentation after writing the source code .R file
#ctrl+shift+B rebuilds package after editing
#to connect existing package to github, make sure project has version control, commit changes, then run in the terminal:
#git remote add origin git@github.com:easoneli176/reponame.git (can copy this link from repo)
#git branch -M main
#git push -u origin main

#if packages need uploading:
#manually find the package in windows, they're stored here: C:\Users\eason\AppData\Local\R\win-library\4.2
#move the package out of that folder and keep it somewhere in case stuff breaks
#then install the newest version. If issues, can go to cran website and get zip file to move into folder
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
